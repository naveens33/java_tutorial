* Default constructor- Java compiler automatically generates a default constructor which is empty and has no parameters.
* The compiler won’t generate the default constructor if there’s a already constructor in the class
* The default constructor is only generated by the compiler
* Constructors are not inherited
* Constructors can be private
* The default constructor has same access modifier as the class
* A constructor calls the default constructor of its superclass
