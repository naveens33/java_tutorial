### Notes about Arrays in Java

* Fixed length: Once an array is created, we cannot change its size. So consider using arrays when the numbers of elements are known and fixed. Otherwise, you * should consider using another dynamic container such as ArrayList.
* Fast access: It’s very fast to access any elements in an array (by index of the elements) in constant time: accessing the 1st element takes same time as accessing the last element. So performance is another factor when choosing arrays.
* An array can hold primitives or objects.
* An array of primitives stores values of the primitives.
* An array of objects stores only the references to the objects.
* In Java, the position of an element is specified by index which is zero-based. That means the first element is at index 0, the second element at index 1, and so on.
* An array itself is actually an object.
